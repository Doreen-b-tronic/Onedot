After completing every challenge and earning the Sock Twins’ trust, Patch finally learned where the missing button had gone. 
It had rolled beneath the laundry basket during the storm, hidden away in the soft shadows of the room. 
With Stitch the Needle Fairy’s gentle guidance, Patch retrieved it at last, feeling a warm sense of relief as the tiny piece rested once more in their hands.
Stitch worked carefully, her needle glowing softly as she stitched the button back onto Patch’s chest with patient, steady loops. 
When the final thread was tied, Patch felt whole again—restored and proud of the courage that carried them through their journey.
As the sewing room settled into its familiar calm, Patch returned to their place among the toys, comforted by the knowledge that even a small creature could brave a big adventure.
